I have noticed a few times that some Japanese speakers use the phoneme /s/
interchangeably with /θ/. I provide no evidence for this claim, only anecdotal
observations, but encourage a study to investigate these observations.

I have noticed that some Japanese speakers use /s/ interchangeably with /θ/, and
have found no supporting research on the topic. The use of this phoneme seems
to be most prominent amongst younger speakers in the Kantou area. I have heard
it from Kantou dialect speakers in their 50s, and in Kantou speakers in their
mid-20s.

The phoneme is still non standard and non contrastive with /s/. We call this
process dentalization.

Amongst speakers who use the phoneme, it appears to occur across all /s/
syllables, for example /so:/ > /θo:/ <そう>; /sasɯ/ > /θaθɯ/ <指す>; and /ise/ >
/iθe/ <伊勢>. This non contrasting phoneme does not affect the different but
related phoneme /ɕ/, as in /iɕin/ <維新>.

It is possible that these observations is the product of lisps in the various
speakers for which it has been noted, but only properly conducted research would
be able to tell conclusively whether this is the case or not.
