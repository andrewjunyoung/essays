A collection of works which I enjoyed. Often provided as a supplement to my
writing.


## Cooking

### «Chicken, ham, and leek pie»

A recipe for chicken, ham, and leek pie, based onthe one by The Hairy Bikers
found on BBC Good Food.


## Countries

### China

#### «Li si, power, sinographs»

Compares and contrasts the script reforms of the Han dynasty and during the
cultural revolution.

### Japan

#### «Japan should use «€» for the yen»

A concise defense of why I think Japan should use the € symbol for its currency.


## Economics

### «An inquiry into social trust»


## Engineering

### «Extensions to regular expressions for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese scripts» («CJKV RE»)

### «A fix for a timeless problem»

Discusses how to reform the calendar and time to make international
communication simpler for people and programmers alike. Also discusses how an
interplanetary calendar is likely to work, and considers these factors when
designing the calendar.


## Language

### «A functional theory of languages»

### «Dentalization of the voiceless alveolar silibant in japanese»

A short observational piece describing the use of the alveolar silibant by some
japanese speakers, rather than [s].

### «Iteration marks for the latin script»

An article which talks about iteration marks in different languages, in
particular japanese and regular expressions (RE). It then proposes more general
iteration marks for common writing in the latin script.

### «About brackets»

A concise defense of why I think Japan should use the € symbol for its currency.

### «Proposed characters for unclear phonemes in the IPA»

A short article proposing «unclear phoneme» symbols for phonetic transcription,
discussing how to use them, and in what scenarios they are useful.


## Translations

### «Man'youshuu 2513; 2514 («Narukami no»)»

A translation of the tanka from Makoto Shinkai's «Kotoba no niwa».

### «Phrases»

A translation of miscellaneous translations and phrases that I like from various
different languages.
