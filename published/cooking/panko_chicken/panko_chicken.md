## Foreword

Most of this bake is in the oven, and the flavoring is all down to spices and
texture. If you're gonna riff on this recipe, those are my recommended places to
start!

You'll be making 2 separate bowls: one of crust, and one of egg. The chicken
will be dipped in egg, then crust, then put onto a baking sheet. If you have 2
people cooking, this will be your chance to parallelize the prep.

This recipe is great with sauces - ketchup and mayo in particular!

## Equipment:
  - oven tray (1)
  - baking paper
  - bowl (1)
  - mixing bowl (1)

## Ingredients:
### Egg coating
  - eggs (2)
### For the crust
  - 200 g panko
  - 5 spice (1 tsp)
  - chili powder (1 tsp)
  - cayenne pepper (1 tsp)
  - turmeric (1 / 2 tsp)
  - onion powder (1 / 2 tsp). I use a polish onion powder (which I only know by
  «czosnek», meaning «onion»), which contains some extra spices in trace
  amounts.
  - oregano (1 generous dash) 
  - salt (to taste). I like to use a fancy salt for this.
  - pepper (to taste)
### Chicken
  - 500 g chicken breast, skinless
  - lemon (1 / 2)

          - onion powder («czosnek» :) )
      - 1 generous dash of oregano
  1. Mix well.
### For the bowl of eggs
  1. Crack 2 eggs into a bowl.
  1. Whisk these eggs well.

### Bringing it all together
  1. For each strip of chicken:
      1. Soak it in egg
      1. Submerge it in the crust until it's fully coated
      1. Place it on the baking tray
  1. Garnish the entire tray with salt and pepper, each to taste.
