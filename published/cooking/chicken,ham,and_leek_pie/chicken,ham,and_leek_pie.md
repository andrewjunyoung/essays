## Foreword

This recipe has you juggling 3 different processes, which all come together in
the main pie bake. These are:
  - [Cooking the chicken](#for-cooking-the-chicken)
  - [Cooking the leek and the sauce](#for-cooking-the-leek-and-the-sauce)
  - [Making the pastry](#for-making-the-pastry)

Finishing the leek and the sauce needs you to have completed the chicken, while
the pastry is done totally separately.

In the recipe below, these 3 processes are described totally separately. But,
the points at which you might want to switch between the 3 processes are
indicated as comments in the method.

It is strongly recommended to start by cooking the chicken.

As with all recipes, you'll probably find that it's much less stressful to have
the ingredients prepared before you start cooking. If that's the case, ignore
the steps which tell you to prepare the ingredients.

If instead, you're pressed for time and want a quick preparation, then follow
each of the steps in the method, as these include when it's recommended to
prepare the ingredients.

## Equipment:
  - A pie dish
  - A measuring cup
  - A kitchen scale
  - A rolling pin (though it is possible without one!)

## Ingredients:
### For the filling:
  - chicken stock (450 ml)
  - chicken breasts (3), skinned and cut into 3 cm pieces
  - butter (75 g)
  - leeks (2 small), cut into 1 ~ 2 cm slices
  - garlic cloves (2), crushed
  - plain flour (50 g)
  - milk (200 ml). I use semi-skimmed
  - white wine (3 ~ 5 tbsp). I recommend sauvignon blanc
  - double cream (150 ml)
  - ham (150 g), cut into 2 cm slices or chunks
  - salt
  - black pepper, ground
### For the pastry:
  - plain flour (350 g)
  - butter (200 g)
  - eggs (2), both beaten individually and kept separate

## Method:
### For cooking the chicken:
  1. Make 450 ml of chicken stock. Heat this up in a lidded pan.
  1. Cut up the chicken breasts into 3 cm pieces.
  1. Add the chicken breast to the pan with the chicken stock and bring to a low simmer.
  1. Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes.
  1. [Go to step 1 of cooking the leek and the sauce](#for-cooking-the-leek-and-the-sauce)
  1. A soon as 10 minutes have passed, remove the chicken breasts from the water with tongs and place them on a plate.
  1. Set aside the remaining liquid into a jug.
  1. [Go back to cooking the leek and the sauce.](#for-cooking-the-leek-and-the-sauce)

### For cooking the leek and the sauce:
  1. Melt 25 g of butter into a large, heavy based pan over low heat. 
  1. Cut up 2 small leeks into 1 ~ 2 cm pieces.
  1. Stir in the leeks and fry gently for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally until just softened.
  1. Add 2 crushed garlic cloves, and cook for 1 more minute.
  1. Add in the remaining 50 g of butter and let it melt.
  1. Once the butter has melted, stir in 50 g of flour.
  1. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
  1. Slowly pour teh milk into the pan a little at a time, stirring well between each adding.
  1. Gradually add 250 ml of the reserved stock, and 3 - 5 tbsp of white wine.
  1. Stir until the sauce is smooth and slightly thickened.
  1. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes.
  1. [At this point, your chicken may just be finishing. Go to the next step of cooking the chicken.](#for-cooking-the-chicken)
  1. Season the mixture with salt and pepper, to taste. I recommend only a little salt (2 or 3 pinches), but a moderate amount of pepper across the top of the pan. 1
  1. Remove from teh heat and stir in 150 ml of double cream.
  1. Pour into a large bowl and cover the surface with cling film to prevent a skin forming.
  1. Set aside to cool.
  1. [Go to making the pastry.](#for-making-the-pastry)

### For making the pastry:
  1. Put 350 g of flour and 200 g of butter into a large bowl. Mix well by hand until the mixture resembels fine breadcrumbs. Don't mix with a mixer -- you won't be able to feel the texture of the dough as you mix it, and may overwork it.
  1. Beat 1 egg in a bowl.
  1. Pour in the egg to the mixture, and blend well by hand until the mixture forms a ball.
  1. Set aside around 250 g of pastry for the lid.
  1. Roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured surface to about 3 mm thickness, and around 4 cm larger than the pie dish.
  1. Lift the pastry sheet and gently place it into the pie tin.
  1. Using a small thumb sized piece of pastry taken from the bowl, gently press the pastry sheet into the edges of the bowl so that it snugly takes the shape of its container. Leave the excess pastry overhanging the sides.
  1. Gently spoon in the chicken, ham, and leeks into the cooled sauce.
  1. Pour this pixture into the pie dish.
  1. Brush the rim of the dish with beaten egg.
  1. Rip off small pieces of the remaining dough, around the size of a thumb. Squish the piece to flatten it in your hand (to around 1 ~ 2 mm thickness), and place it on top of the pie.
  1. Repeat this process until the lid is covered. Then, repeat it again with the remaining dough, giving your pie multiple layers of top. These will flake slightly in the oven. Let air get through the layers you create.
  1. Beat 1 medium egg in a bowl.
  1. Using a brush, cover the lid with around 3 / 4 of the beaten egg. The remaining 1 / 4 of the egg is not needed.
  1. Shape the corners and edges of the pastry if you want.
  1. Bake the pie in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the pie is golden-brown all over and the filling is piping hot.
  1. If taken out before 40 minutes, ensure the base is not undercooked.
